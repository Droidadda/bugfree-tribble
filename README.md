# Various helpful scripts
These are scripts I'm using on my computer to help with, well, really anything. They are not particularly nice or anything, I just like to have them backed-up somewhere, as they are useful.

`install.sh` places symlinks to those scripts to `/usr/local/bin`, `install.sh uninstall` removes them.

*PS: I've decided to go with github's auto-generated repository name, so let's see what happens...*
